    my $raw_cookie = 'foo=a%20phrase;haha; bar=yes%2C%20a%20phrase; baz=%5Ewibble&leiyh; qux=%27';
    my $res = Cookie::XS->parse($raw_cookie);
    # $res is something like:
    #    {
    #      'bar' => [
    #                 'yes, a phrase'
    #               ],
    #      'baz' => [
    #                 '^wibble',
    #                 'leiyh'
    #               ],
    #      'foo' => [
    #                 'a phrase',
    #                 'haha'
    #               ],
    #      'qux' => [
    #                 '\''
    #               ]
    #    };

    # or directly read raw cookies from the CGI environments:
    $res = Cookie::XS->fetch;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a very simple parser for cookies used in HTTP applications. We've found L<CGI::Simple::Cookie> and L<CGI::Cookie> rather slow according to the profiling results for our L<OpenResty> project, hence the rewrite in C.

This library is still in B<pre-alpha> stage and the API is still in flux. We're just following the "release early, releaes often" guideline. So please check back often ;)

=head1 METHODS

We currently provide 2 static methods, C<parse> and C<fetch>. They work mostly the same way as those methods found in L<CGI::Cookie> and L<CGI::Simple::Cookie> but with the exception that our version returns plain Perl data structures rather than hashes of Perl objects (due to performance considerations).

We'll implement some cookie dump methods in the near future.

=head1 BUGS

There must be some serious bugs lurking somewhere. We haven't done comprehensive testing for our code yet. It's a TODO.
