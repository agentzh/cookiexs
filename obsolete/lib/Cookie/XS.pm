Cookie::XS - HTTP Cookie parser in C (Please use CGI::Cookie::XS instead)

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Cookie::XS 0.11 released on September 12, 2008.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Cookie::XS;

    my $raw_cookie = 'foo=a%20phrase; haha; bar=yes%2C%20a%20phrase; baz=%5Ewibble&leiyh; qux=%27';
    my $res = Cookie::XS->parse($raw_cookie);
    # $res is something like:
    #    {
    #      'bar' => [
    #                 'yes, a phrase'
    #               ],
    #      'baz' => [
    #                 '^wibble',
    #                 'leiyh'
    #               ],
    #      'foo' => [
    #                 'a phrase'
    #               ],
    #      'qux' => [
    #                 '\''
    #               ]
    #    };

    # or directly read raw cookies from the CGI environments:
    $res = Cookie::XS->fetch;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<WARNING: This module is obsolete now; please use CGI::Cookie::XS instead.>

This module implements a very simple parser for cookies used in HTTP applications. We've found L<CGI::Simple::Cookie> and L<CGI::Cookie> rather slow according to the profiling results for our L<OpenResty> project, hence the rewrite in C.

This library is still in B<pre-alpha> stage and the API is still in flux. We're just following the "release early, releaes often" guideline. So please check back often ;)

=head1 METHODS

We currently provide 2 static methods, C<parse> and C<fetch>. They work mostly the same way as those methods found in L<CGI::Cookie> and L<CGI::Simple::Cookie> but with the exception that our version returns plain Perl data structures rather than hashes of Perl objects (due to performance considerations).

We'll implement some cookie dump methods in the near future.

=over

=item C<< $ref = Cookie::XS->parse($raw_cookie) >>

Parses C<$raw_cookie> and returns the reference of a hash of arrays. The keys
of the hash are cookie variables' names while the values of the hash are lists of cookie variable's values.

There is a length limit on the C<$raw_cookie>. If C<$raw_cookie> is longer than 4 KB (i.e. 4 * 1024 bytes, excluding the trailing '\0'), the overflowing part will be truncated.

Also note that, C<fetch> does not assume any encoding on the cookie values. It just decodes the encoded entries verbatim and treat them as plain "binary" stuff.

=item C<< $ref = Cookie::XS->fetch() >>

Reads the raw cookie from the C<HTTP_COOKIE> and C<COOKIE> environments
(which are usually set by HTTP servers like lighttd or apache) and then
parses the value using the C<parse> method and finally returns the
results.
